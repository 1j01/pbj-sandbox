This is a little experiment I did a while ago, a point-based physics sandbox.

## Project Status

The code is a mess, and this project isn't going anywhere.

(Unless it's rewritten... probably with code from, or using [Skele2D][].
It could be like an example program, just a physics sandbox, using that interface for moving points around and everything.)
